    <h2>Green chili is a Colorado favorite, it's always a crowd pleaser when we have out-of-state visitors. Roasting your veggies first gives this recipe a deeper level of flavor. This can be served over rice as a main course, stuffed in enchiladas, or over potatoes and eggs.</h2>

        <li>3 Anaheim chile peppers - seeded and halved</li>
        <li>3 jalapeno peppers - seeded and halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, halved</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, seeded and halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch chunk</li>
        <li>½ (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lager-style beer</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 beef bouillon cube</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Arrange the halved tomatillos, Anaheim chiles, jalapeños, onion, and bell pepper on a baking sheet. Drizzle vegetables with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt.</li>
        <li>Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until they begin to show brown spots, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool, then chop vegetables into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add pork and fry until browned, seasoning with salt and black pepper as it cooks, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer pork to a slow cooker; stir in roasted vegetables. Mix in beer, tomatoes, garlic, oregano, parsley, cumin, chili powder, and bouillon. Cover and cook on Low until pork is tender, 4 to 6 hours.</li>
        <li>About 1/2 hour before serving, place cream cheese into a bowl and stir in about 1 tablespoon of the chili liquid until thoroughly combined. Continue stirring in chili broth, a tablespoon at a time, until the cream cheese is almost a liquid. Stir cream cheese mixture back into the chili.</li>
    </ol>
